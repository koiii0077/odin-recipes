# odin-recipes
In this project I learned to make a recipe webpage, with 3 recipes inside it
I learned how to make a simple recipe for my 3 favorites dishes
On each recipe I learn how to put an image, brief description of the recipe, and add the ingredients and steps for that recipe
And last including all the links of the websites to the main Odin Recipe page
